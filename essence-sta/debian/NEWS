wpa (2:2.4-1+deb9u3) stretch-security; urgency=high

  This release backports changes to help mitigate EAP-pwd security issues
  (CVE-2019-9495, CVE-2019-9497, CVE-2019-9498, CVE-2019-9499).
  Unfortunately, the complete fix heavily depends on the code added after
  wpa 2.4 release, so porting it is not practical. Consider using strong
  passwords to prevent dictionary attacks.

  For more information about the issues and their impace, see the Debian
  Security Advisory DSA-4430-1.
  For even more details, please read the following documents:

    - https://w1.fi/security/2019-2/eap-pwd-side-channel-attack.txt
    - https://w1.fi/security/2019-4/eap-pwd-missing-commit-validation.txt

  Should you need a more complete fix, please consider upgrading to a newer
  version from stretch-backports when it becomes available.

wpasupplicant (0.6.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The -w (wait for network interface to exist) command line option no longer
  exists. If you have scripts that require this option, it is time to change
  them, or use one of the two supported modes of operation explained at
  /usr/share/doc/wpasupplicant/README.modes.gz.

  ifupdown supports hot-plugged network devices via the "allow-hotplug" class
  of operation. An example /etc/network/interfaces configuration stanza would
  look like:

  allow-hotplug wlan0
  iface wlan0 inet dhcp
          wpa-ssid myssid
          wpa-psk mysecretpassphrase

  network-manager is also able to handle hot-plugged network devices.
